Project Name: Super Social Reader

Project Description: At its core the web app will be a superhero comics reader tracker where users can create currently reading objects (with a set of attributes) to keep track of their reads and leave thoughts about books they’ve finished. Users will be able to see what other readers are doing/reading, with the ability to comment, on other users’ reads. The initial plan is to integrate this app with the superheroes index api, to help people new to the genre generate ideas about what characters to read.
